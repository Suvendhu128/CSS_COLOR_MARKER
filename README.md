# CSS_COLOR_MARKER
CSS COLOR MARKERS
This code creates three different types of CSS color markers:

Sets the width of the .d1_red, .d2_red, and .d3_red elements to 25%, 75%, and 10%, respectively.
Sets the background image of the .d1_red, .d2_red, and .d3_red elements to a linear gradient.
The linear gradient starts with the color rgba(255, 0, 0,1) and ends with the color rgba(255, 0, 0,0.5).
The linear gradient has 3 stops, which means that there will be 2 intermediate colors between the starting and ending colors.
The alpha value for the starting color is 1, which means that the color is completely opaque.
The alpha value for the ending color is 0.5, which means that the color is semi-transparent.
The alpha values for the intermediate colors will be somewhere in between 0 and 1.
In summary, the CSS code you provided creates three linear gradients that transition from solid red to a semi-transparent red color. The exact hue of the color will depend on the values of the starting and ending colors, as well as the number of stops.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

CSS
.d1_red {
  width: 25%;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    rgba(255, 0, 0,1),
    rgba(255, 0, 0,0.5)
  );
}

The width: 25% property sets the width of the .d1_red element to 25% of the width of its parent element.

The background-image: linear-gradient() property sets the background image of the .d1_red element to a linear gradient. The linear gradient starts with the color rgba(255, 0, 0,1) and ends with the color rgba(255, 0, 0,0.5). The linear gradient has 3 stops, which means that there will be 2 intermediate colors between the starting and ending colors.

The rgba() function is used to create a color with an alpha value. The alpha value specifies the opacity of the color. In this case, the alpha value for the starting color is 1, which means that the color is completely opaque. The alpha value for the ending color is 0.5, which means that the color is semi-transparent. The alpha values for the intermediate colors will be somewhere in between 0 and 1.
